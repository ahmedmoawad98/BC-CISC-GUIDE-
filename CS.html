<h1>Computer Science</h1>

<h2> Whose should pursue a Computer Science Degree? </h1>
<p>Anyone who has a general interest in computers and programming. It is best for students who want to work as a programmer or systems analyst. This major will prepare you for all non-specialized fields of computing.</p>


<h2> Helpful tips </h1> 

<ul>
<li>  Students must complete General Pathway Requirements along with the Computer Science major courses to complete their Bachelors of Science Degree in Computer Science. </li>

<li> To enroll in a CIS course, a student must have passed all prerequisite courses in the CIS department with a grade of C or higher. </li>

<li> To enroll in a Math course, a student must have passed all Math prerequisite courses with a D- or better. </li>

<li> Incoming students who have programming experience should consult a department advisor. </li>

<li>Any student who is not familiar with Microsoft Word, Excel, Access and/or PowerPoint is advised to also take CISC 1050 during his or her college studies.</li>

<h1> Suggested Schedule and Flowchart</h1>






<h1> Possible Schedules </h1>

<p> * In the schedules below, elective means any course in CIS numbered from 3000 to 4899.</p>

<h2>Four Year Schedule:</h2>

<p>This schedule is recommended for students who are Freshman. They need to combine two or three pathway courses along with this schedule per semester.</p>

<h3>First semester: CISC 1115, and MATH 1011 or 1201</h3>
<h3>Second semester: CISC 2210, CISC 3115, and MATH 1201 or 1206</h3>
<h3>Third semester: CISC 2820W, CISC </h3>
<h3>Fourth semester: CISC 3305 or 3310, and MATH 1206 or 2501 </h3>
<h3>Fifth semester: CISC 3142, and either CISC 3220 or CISC 3230</h3>
<h3>Sixth semester: CISC 3150, CISC 3320, and MATH 2501 (if necessary) </h3>
<h3>Seventh semester: CISC 4900 or 5001, and one elective </h3>
<h3>Eighth semester: one or more electives, possibly CISC 4905 or 5002</h3>


<h2>Three Year Schedule:</h2>

<p>This schedule is recommended for students who decided to major in Computer Science in their second year. They need to combine two or three pathway courses along with this schedule per semester. </p>

<h3>Third semester: CISC 1115, MATH 1011 or 1201</h3>
<h3> Fourth semester: CISC 2210, CISC 3115, MATH 1201 or 1206 </h3>
<h3>Fifth semester: CISC 2820W, CISC 3130, CISC 3305 or 3310, MATH 1206 or 2501 </h3>
<h3>Sixth semester: CISC 3220 or 3230; CISC 3320 or 3150, MATH 2501 if needed </h3>
<h3>Seventh semester: CISC 3142, CISC 3320 or 3150, and one elective </h3>
<h3>Eighth semester: CISC 4900 or 5001, and one elective</h3>


<h2>Two-and-One-Half Year Schedule:</h2>

<p> This schedule is only recommended for students who have taken CISC 1115 in their fourth semester. It would be very difficult to manage classes afterwards since students would have to take summer or winter classes in order to graduate with this degree on time. Students are encouraged to see a counselor before undertaking this schedule. </p>

<h3>Fourth semester: CISC 1115, CISC 2820W, and MATH 1011 or 1201, CISC 3800</h3>
