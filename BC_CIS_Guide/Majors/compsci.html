<h1>Computer Science</h1>

<h2> Whose should pursue a Computer Science Degree? </h2>
<p>Anyone who has a general interest in computers and programming. It is best for students who want to work as a programmer or systems analyst. This major will prepare you for all non-specialized fields of computing.</p>


<h2> Helpful tips </h1>

<ul>
<li>  Students must complete General Pathway Requirements along with the Computer Science major courses to complete their Bachelors of Science Degree in Computer Science. </li>

<li> To enroll in a CIS course, a student must have passed all prerequisite courses in the CIS department with a grade of C or higher. </li>

<li> To enroll in a Math course, a student must have passed all Math prerequisite courses with a D- or better. </li>

<li> Incoming students who have programming experience should consult a department advisor. </li>

<li>Any student who is not familiar with Microsoft Word, Excel, Access and/or PowerPoint is advised to also take CISC 1050 during his or her college studies.</li>
